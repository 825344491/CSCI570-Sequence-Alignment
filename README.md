# Sequence alignment based on divide-and-conquer with dynamic programming
 - Implemented the algorithm for finding an optimal alignment of two given sequences in two ways: using pure dynamic programming and divide-and-conquer with dynamic programming, which improve the basic version by using only linear space within same time complexity.
 - Plot CPU time and memory usage vs problem size for the two version of implementations for comparison using given test cases and analyze the results theoretically.
